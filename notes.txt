- can't be stateless when subscribing because might already have a video
- have a "subscribing" state while fetching list of urls

when downloading a video, save to a temp dir and move+update table only when finished, empty this dir on startup

when subscribe, fetch whole playlist of URLs, and then exclude those already in table/wip-set

once URL of video is known it goes in a WIP set, in memory and on disk (and maybe also a JSON file? so can reconstruct w/o db), and subscribing transitions to subscribed

when checking for new videos, also have to check WIP set; presence there counts

maybe have a "subscribed" JSON?
